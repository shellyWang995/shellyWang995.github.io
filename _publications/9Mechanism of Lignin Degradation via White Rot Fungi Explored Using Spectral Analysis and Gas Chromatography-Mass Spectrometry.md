excerpt: '
This study demonstrates that white rot fungi, specifically Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Pleurotus ostreatus, can effectively degrade alkali lignin, with degradation efficiency dependent on substrate concentration and enzyme activity, leading to the formation of organic acids, esters, and aromatic substances.'
